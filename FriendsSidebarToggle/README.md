# Friends Sidebar Toggle

A Spicetify extension that adds a button to toggle the friend activity sidebar. Display friend activity must be turned on in settings.

Large quantities of the code were shamelessly stolen from [Remove Friends Activity Menu](https://github.com/Undead34/spicetify-extensions), which seems abandoned.
